/**
 * Non-pipelining implementation of {@link HttpConnection} interface.
 * <p/>
 * Since some server implementations aren't fully <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a> compliant
 * when it comes to pipelining, this is the default implementation.
 * <p/>
 * If you are sure the servers you will be connecting to support pipelining correctly, you can use the {@linkplain
 * PipeliningHttpConnection pipelining version}.
 * <p/>
 * This implementation only accepts one request at a time. If {@link
 * #execute(com.biasedbit.http.HttpRequestContext) execute()} is called while {@link #isAvailable()} would
 * return false, the request will be accepted and immediately fail with {@link HttpRequestFuture#EXECUTION_REJECTED}
 * <strong>unless</strong> the socket has been disconnected (in which case the request will not fail but
 * {@link #execute(HttpRequestContext)} will return {@code false} instead).
