/**
 * An HTTP connection to a server.
 * <p/>
 * HTTP requests are dispatched from the {@link com.biasedbit.http.client.HttpClient} to the {@code Connection}s
 * under the form of a {@link com.biasedbit.http.client.util.RequestContext}.
 * <p/>
 * To execute requests in a {@code Connection}, the caller must always ensure the connection can process its request
 * by calling {@link #isAvailable()} prior to {@link #execute(com.biasedbit.http.client.util.RequestContext) execute()}.
 * <p/>
 * Example:
 * <pre class="code">
 * if (connection.isAvailable) {
 *     // This is not guaranteed to work.. Connection may go down or be termianted by other thread meanwhile!
 *     connection.execute(request);
 * }</pre>
 * Implementations of this interface are thread-safe. However, it is ill-advised to used them from multiple threads in
 * order to avoid entropic behavior. If you really want to use a single connection from multiple threads, you should
 * manually synchronise externally. The reason for this is that if both threads call {@link #isAvailable()} at the same
 * time, both will be able to {@linkplain #execute(com.biasedbit.http.client.util.RequestContext) submit requests}, even
 * though the implementation may not accept both (and consequently fail the last one with
 * {@link com.biasedbit.http.client.future.RequestFuture#EXECUTION_REJECTED}).
 * <p/>
 * Example:
 * <pre class="code">
 * synchronized (connection) {
 *     if (connection.isAvailable) {
 *         // This is not guaranteed to work.. Connection may close meanwhile!
 *         connection.execute(request);
 *     }
 * }</pre>
 * The reason for this implementation decision is making the common case fast: a vast majority of the times that
 * {@link #isAvailable()} is called, {@link #execute(com.biasedbit.http.client.util.RequestContext) execute()} will
 * accept the request. So rather than having only execute returning {@code true} or {@code false} based on the
 * connection availibility, this quicker call is a very reliable heuristic to determine if requests can be submitted
 * or not.
 *
 * <div class="note">
 * <div class="header">Note:</div>
 * There is no guarantee that a request will be approved if {@link #isAvailable()} returned true. Even though the
 * odds are extremely slim, the connection may go down between the call to {@link #isAvailable()} and {@link
 * #execute(com.biasedbit.http.client.util.RequestContext) execute()}.
 * <p/>For such cases (and only for such cases)
 * {@link #execute(com.biasedbit.http.client.util.RequestContext) execute()} will return {@code false}
 * rather than fail, the request in order for the caller to be given the chance to retry the same request in another
 * connection.
 * <p/>
 * In every other scenario where {@link #isAvailable()} returns false, calling
 * {@link #execute(com.biasedbit.http.client.util.RequestContext) execute()} <strong>will fail</strong> the request
 * (with cause {@link com.biasedbit.http.client.future.RequestFuture#EXECUTION_REJECTED}).
